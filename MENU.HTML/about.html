House at 8A, Bulevardul Aviatorilor, Bucharest, Romania
A house is a single-unit residential building. It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.[21][22]

The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household. Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals. Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.[citation needed] Houses may provide "certain activities, which gradually accumulate meaning until they become homes".[19]

Joseph Rykwert distinguished between home and house in their physicality; a house requires a building whereas a home does not.[23] Home and house are often used interchangeably, although their connotations may differ: house being "emotionally netural" and home evoking "personal, cognitive aspects".[19][24] By the mid-18th century, the definition of home had extended beyond a house.[14] "Few English words are filled with the emotional meaning of the word home".[13]
